# Online judge solution
This repository contains my solutions for problems of different online judges. 

This repository don't have all of the solutions for all the problems I have solved. Because for the judges which have feature to see solutions, I usually coded these problem in a same file and had not saved these solutions locally.

Some solutions may not be accepted solutions, since I have uploaded all the codes from my solution folder.

Some problems may have multiple solutions with different idea or different implementation, though some of them may not be accepted solution, because sometimes I have coded by creating new file after failing to get a solution accepted by online judge.
